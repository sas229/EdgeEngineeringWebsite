The EDGE operator app, mounted on a tablet attached directly to the machine, acts as a centralised hub for efficient maintenance management. It features a structured daily or weekly checklist with clear, step-by-step instructions, guiding operators through critical routine tasks.

By ensuring these checks are consistently performed, the app promotes regular machine upkeep and significantly reduces the risk of maintenance oversights.

Furthermore, it seamlessly integrates with remote sensor data, providing real-time alerts for potential monitoring alarms. This synergy of routine management and real-time diagnostics enhances machine reliability and supports proactive maintenance strategies.
