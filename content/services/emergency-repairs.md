We are available 24/7 to perform emergency field repairs. Edge Engineering has four fully equipped vehicles ready to attend your mechanical breakdowns at a momentâ€™s notice. Understanding the critical nature of machinery downtime we have adapted to be as responsive and reliable as possible.

If you require a more in-depth planned overhaul and rebuild, we have the capacity to perform these tasks on-site or in-house at our Embelton workshop. We have extensive knowledge with all mechanical components that a machine may have form spindles to apron boxes. Other overhaul and rebuild services offered include:

* Gearbox Rebuilds
* Lubrication Re-designs
* Hand Scraping and Flaking sideways
